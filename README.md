GitHub: A code hosting platform used for version control and collaborative development, enabling team workflows and repository management.

GitHub Actions: A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub, used to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying the application.

Database Design
1. User
User_ID: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).

First_Name: Userâ€™s first name.

Email: User's email address, used for authentication and communication.

Role: Defines the role of the user (e.g., Admin, Host, Customer).

Date_Joined: The date the user registered in the system.

Relationship:

A User can have multiple Properties (a host can list many properties).

A User can make multiple Bookings (customers book properties).

A User can write multiple Reviews for different properties.

A User can have multiple Payments related to their bookings.

2. Property

Host_ID: Foreign Key that links to the User entity (the host who owns the property).

Name: Name or title of the property.

Price_Per_Night: The price of the property per night.

Address: The physical address of the property.

Relationship:

Property_ID: Foreign Key that links to the Property entity (the property being booked).

Check_In_Date: The date when the customer checks in.

Total_Price: The total amount for the booking (calculated based on duration and price per night).

Relationship:

A Booking belongs to one User (the customer who made the booking).

Amount: The amount paid for the booking.

Payment_Method: The method of payment (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal).

Payment_Status: The status of the payment (e.g., successful, failed, pending).

Relationship:

A Payment is linked to one Booking (a payment is made for a specific booking).

A Payment relates to the User through the Booking entity, as the user makes the payment for the booking.

Summary of Entity Relationships:
User to Property: One-to-many. A user can list multiple properties (if they are a host).

Property to Booking: One-to-many. A property can have multiple bookings over time.

User to Review: One-to-many. A user can write many reviews, but each review is for one property.

Property to Review: One-to-many. A property can receive multiple reviews from different users.

Booking to Payment: One-to-one. Each booking has one payment associated with it.

 API Security
 1. Authentication
What: Authentication ensures that the user is who they claim to be. We will use secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for user login and API access.

Why it's crucial: Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing private endpoints or performing sensitive operations (e.g., booking a property, accessing user profiles). Without it, anyone could access the system, posing significant risks to user data.

2. Authorization
What: Authorization defines what authenticated users can do within the system. For example, only the host (property owner) can edit the property details, and only customers can make bookings. This will be controlled by user roles.

Why it's crucial: Authorization ensures that users only have access to the data and actions they are permitted to use, preventing potential abuse or unauthorized changes to the system (e.g., preventing one user from deleting another user's property).

3. Rate Limiting
What: Rate limiting will be implemented to restrict the number of requests a user or client can make to the API within a certain time frame (e.g., 100 requests per minute). This is to prevent abuse such as DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks.

Why it's crucial: Rate limiting helps protect the server from overload and ensures fair access for all users. It also prevents malicious users from attempting brute force attacks on login endpoints or flooding the system with unnecessary requests.

4. Encryption
What: All sensitive data such as passwords, payment information, and user profiles will be encrypted both at rest and in transit. We will use SSL/TLS for encrypted communication between the client and server.

Why it's crucial: Encryption protects sensitive information from being intercepted by attackers. For example, payment details need to be encrypted to prevent fraud, and user passwords should never be stored in plaintext.

5. Input Validation and Sanitization
What: The system will validate and sanitize all incoming data to ensure it adheres to expected formats. This will prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other forms of attacks that exploit input fields.

Why it's crucial: Without proper validation and sanitization, the API is vulnerable to malicious input that could compromise the integrity of the system or expose sensitive data.

6. Error Handling
What: The API will implement proper error handling mechanisms to avoid revealing sensitive details in error messages, such as stack traces or database information.

Why it's crucial: Exposing detailed error messages can give attackers clues about the structure of the system and how to exploit vulnerabilities. By masking this information, we reduce the risk of exploitation.

CI/CD Pipeline
What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is an automated system used to ensure that code changes are consistently integrated and deployed with minimal human intervention. The pipeline enables continuous development by automating the processes of testing, building, and deploying code.

Continuous Integration (CI): Refers to automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. It involves running automated tests to ensure the code works as expected.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Involves automatically deploying the integrated code to production after it passes the necessary tests. This ensures that the application is always in a deployable state and allows for quick delivery of features and bug fixes.

Why is a CI/CD Pipeline Important?
Faster Development Cycle: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than manual processes.

Improved Code Quality: Automated tests help catch bugs early, ensuring that only well-tested code is deployed.

Consistent Releases: By automating the deployment process, CI/CD ensures that all code changes go through the same steps, leading to more reliable releases.

Rapid Feedback: Developers get immediate feedback about the status of their code, allowing them to fix issues quickly and efficiently.

Reduced Risk: Continuous deployment ensures that smaller, incremental changes are deployed more frequently, making it easier to identify and roll back problematic changes.

Tools for CI/CD
Several tools can be used to implement a CI/CD pipeline, depending on the needs of the project:

GitHub Actions: A native CI/CD tool for GitHub repositories that can automate the build, test, and deployment processes. It is flexible and integrates well with other services.

Docker: Docker containers are used to package applications and their dependencies, making it easier to build and deploy code consistently across different environments.

Jenkins: A widely-used open-source automation server that can automate various stages of the CI/CD pipeline, from building to deployment.

Travis CI: Another popular tool that integrates with GitHub to automate testing and deployment.

CircleCI: A cloud-based CI/CD service that allows automated testing and deployment of code with easy integration into the GitHub workflow.
